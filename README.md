 Dear Connections,

Recently I attended a 3 days workshop " Hands-On Applicative Data Science Workshop by Coders Ready" on Coding with python at CODERS READY.
The workshop covered the length and breadth of python right from the basics of python to the advance level.
I got benefitted a lot by this workshop, not just at coding knowledge level but also understood the logic of coding. we worked on a lot of interesting coding concepts.
Here, I would extend my heartfelt thanks to all the mentors, Instructors at Coders Ready and my college professors for organizing such a great workshop which gave me an providing me this opportunity to learn and grow. (YOU CAN TAG YOUR FELLOW FRIENDS ALSO)
